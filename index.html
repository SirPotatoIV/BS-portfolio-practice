                    I grew up thinking I'd be an engineer, which progressed to wanting to engineer medical devices. 
                    I went on to get a degree in biomedical engineering and work in the field of medical device R&amp;D 
                    for 6 years. Over those 6 years I realized I was wrong growing up. The life of an engineer who
                    works to develop medical devices was not for me. At the age of 29 and after 6 years of giving
                    engineering a try I decided to quit my job and pursue a career in web development. I am currently
                    in a 3-month full-time full stack web development bootcamp hoping to find the career that is right
                    for me.

                <p>
                    When I'm not working diligently to pursue a new career I enjoy Curling, hanging out with my wife
                    and dog, exploring the Twin Cities, and learning how to make physical things. I have hobby aspirations
                    to learn more about saws, routers, nail guns, CNC's, and all other sorts of tools that could help me make
                    interesting physical objects, or cause me to loose appendages. I hope to be able to meld together my knowledge
                    of code and building physical things to make fun and strange projects.
