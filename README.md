Title: My Portfolio Bootstrap Version

Description: The purpose of this project was to rebuild my-portfolio, the previous homework assignment, using bootstrap. This is a homework assignment for a web developer bootcamp.

Installation: If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

Usage: The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and more specifically Bootstrap. It could be used as a template for a portflio site, but I wouldn't recommend.

Credits: I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Credits for images and background are located in the html or css. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. These have also been cited.

Contributing: I was the only one to work on this project.

Challenges: I struggled early on with the sticky footer due to not adding the bootstrap scripts for the javascript code.
