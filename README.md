Title: My Portfolio Bootstrap Version

Description: The purpose of this project was to rebuild my-portfolio, the previous homework assignment, using bootstrap. This is a homework assignment for a web developer bootcamp.

Installation: If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

Usage: The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and more specifically Bootstrap. It could be used as a template for a portflio site, but I wouldn't recommend.

Credits: I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Credits for images and background are located in the html or css. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. These have also been cited.

Contributing: I was the only one to work on this project.

Challenges: I struggled early on with the sticky footer due to not adding the bootstrap scripts for the javascript code. I also struggled heavily with the navBar. At first I used a navBar from Bootstrap, which worked great. I then decided to try and make a navbar look exactly like the navbar in the homework pictures. Even after being told to use the navBar from bootstrap I still for some reason faught and faught to get it to work. This project has started to teach me to leave things alone if they work and they meet the homework requirements.
